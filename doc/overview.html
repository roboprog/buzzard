There are currently only 2 modules in the library ready for general use:
<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="#bzrt_alloc">
	a memory sub-allocation manager that uses a stack data structure as
	a sub-heap and which supports reference counting;
	</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	<a href="#bzrt_bytes">
	a byte-array module which can be used to extract subranges and to
	merge arrays, as well as be used as a base for (8 bit) strings with
	an out of band length indicator.
